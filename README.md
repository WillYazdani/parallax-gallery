Parallax Gallery

Technologies: HTML, CSS, Sass, React
Roll: Solo Developer

I always wondered when I was taking photos how I could capture more informormation with a single image. If only I could make the view feel as if they were actually in the scene. I stumbled upon a really cool parallax scrolling effect on a website that make me think that I could actually take my photos to the next level and achieve what I had previously dreamed of.

This is a gallery built in react that uses parallax to make the images have a 3D effect. Hover over the images to see the effect. All photos are taken and edited by myself.
